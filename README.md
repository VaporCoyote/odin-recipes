# odin-recipes

This website is a recipes website I was instructed to build at theodinproject.com. It consists of a home page with links to three recipe pages.

In making this website I have demostrated building a boilerplate for html documents, then further adding headings, images, ordered lists and unordered lists. I also demostrated using relative links and absolute links to link to internal web pages and an external web page.
