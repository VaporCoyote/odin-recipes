        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Tacos are a popular hand-sized food item originating from Mexico. They consist of a tortilla made from either wheat or corn, filled with a variety of ingredients. Typically, tacos are seasoned with a spicy salsa and are meant to be eaten by hand.</p>
        <p>In the United States, tacos have gained significant popularity. Fast-food chains like Taco Bell specialize in Tex-Mex dishes, including various types of tacos. American-style tacos can be made with soft flour tortillas or crispy corn shells filled with ingredients like ground beef, lettuce, onions, tomatoes, and cheese (often Cheddar). Tacos can also be customized with toppings like sour cream or chili sauce and come in vegetarian options or with different proteins like grilled steak or chicken.</p>
