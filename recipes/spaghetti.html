        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Spaghetti with meatballs is an Italian-American pasta dish that typically consists of spaghetti noodles, tomato sauce, and meatballs. The dish originated from southern Italy but was further developed by Italian immigrants in the United States. While the traditional Italian version features smaller meatballs, the Italian-American adaptation often includes larger meatballs.</p>
